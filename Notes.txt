## DATA PREPROCESSING
It's important to put different variables on a common scale, so that extreme variables 
don't have more weight than others
{} scale - change the range of the values. The shape of the distribution doesn't change.
{} normalize - bringing data points that were extreme before closer to the middle, 
so that they are less extreme (normal/Gaussian distribution). If you see a large standard deviation,
then you should probably normalize/standardize the data.
