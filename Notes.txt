## DATA PREPROCESSING
It's important to put different variables on a common scale, so that extreme variables 
don't have more weight than others
{} scale - change the range of the values. The shape of the distribution doesn't change.
{} normalize - bringing data points that were extreme before closer to the middle, 
so that they are less extreme (normal/Gaussian distribution). If you see a large standard deviation,
then you should probably normalize/standardize the data.


{} feedforward, backpropagation
{} divide dataset into training and validation

## IMPLEMENTATION
{} at least 2 hidden layers
{} softmax funciton
{} display at each epoch the training and validation metrics (model performance)
{} implement a learning curve graph displayed at the end of the training phase
{} training program
{} prediction program - binary cross entropy error function
